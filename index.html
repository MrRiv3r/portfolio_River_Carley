      <p>This is a collection i made in my free time based around the visual repersentation of the cogitive sensation and phunominon of imagaination. I wanted to show the idea of how creative ideas are formed in three different styles. the left most image is about the cristilisation of an idea and done in a realsistic stye in corel painter. the senter most image is about how the mind stretches to accomidate new ideas and done in a surearealistic style and in photo shop. the right mnost image is about how the mind travels on a current and i represented the mind as an abstract leaf on the wind or water and done with more traditional mediams of marker and pen. the right most is my favorite of the three becuase it looks like a lot of different things when rotated</p>

      <h2>Websites</h2>
    <h3>Book Sugester</h3>
    <p>A school project where we had to create a informative website around an interest. I chose reading as my interst and collected all the books i read that year and created a quiz that would suggest a book based on your three answers. this website is highly adaptive to screen size and also includes a light and dark mode. this was my first website and it relied very heavly on jave script</p>
    <h3>Lecture Series Website</h3>
    <p>A school project developing a web page for a lecure series taking place at ocadu. the main objective of the project was to use a input method and create a unique expernce around that input, my assigned method was clicking. the website has several instances of clikc interaction from the expantion of the artist pannels, the pop ups of the art work, and the links. Another facet of this project was to design adaptive webpages that would change layout based on screen size.</p>
    <h3>Personal Webpage</h3>
    <p>this is a link to my personal webstie if you would like to see more or purchuse any work</p>
