      </div>
      <p>This is a collection i made in my free time based around the visual repersentation of the cogitive sensation and phunominon of imagaination. I wanted to show the idea of how creative ideas are formed in three different styles. the left most image is about the cristilisation of an idea and done in a realsistic stye in corel painter. the senter most image is about how the mind stretches to accomidate new ideas and done in a surearealistic style and in photo shop. the right mnost image is about how the mind travels on a current and i represented the mind as an abstract leaf on the wind or water and done with more traditional mediams of marker and pen. the right most is my favorite of the three becuase it looks like a lot of different things when rotated</p>

      <h2>Websites</h2>

    <p>A school project developing a web page for a lecure series taking place at ocadu. the main objective of the project was to use a input method and create a unique expernce around that input, my assigned method was clicking. the website has several instances of clikc interaction from the expantion of the artist pannels, the pop ups of the art work, and the links. Another facet of this project was to design adaptive webpages that would change layout based on screen size. it can be seen through this <a href="https://rivercarley.github.io/posterthree/" target="_blank">link</a>    </p>
